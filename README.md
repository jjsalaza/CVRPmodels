# CVRPmodels
Julia code with Several Mixed-Integer Linear-Programming formulations for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem

"cvrp.jl" is a source code implementing several mathematical formulations of the classical CVRP. The instances to be solved should be in CVRPLIB format. There are compact and non-compact formulations. There are also branch-and-cut, branch-and-price and branch-and-cut-and-price formulations. No one will give you the fastest implementation to solve the largest possible CVRP instance today. The intention of writing and publishing this source code is mainly to help PhD students compare different models and get familiar with strengthening by doing experiments on a computer.
